            <h2>The Task</h2>
            <p>The task for this project was to design and develop a solution to promoting a singular product using original content </p>
        </section>
        <section class="requirements">
            <h2>The Requirements</h2>
            <p>The requirments of this project were straight forward, below is a list of them </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Original Content</li>
                <li>Layout Supported Across Devices</li>
                <li>Semantic Code</li>
                <li>Work completed to current standards</li>
                <li>SASS should be used</li>
                <li>Well commented</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="process">
            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>The process began by looking at current candle e-commerce websites and seeing what the key details they had easily on show for users to see, using this information, three sketches were produced and had 5-second tests ran on them with users in order to gain an understanding of the design direction that would be taken. Following that, a proactive Journey Map was produced, this would help define how users would behave on the website. </p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Taking the photos to produce unique content for the website was initially planned to be conducted like a solo product shoot on clear white backing to remove anything that wasn’t the product, however after perusing this path and discovering it just wasn’t working, the direction was changed to include other items/backing that would help promote features of the candle, the photo shown shows a nice healthy green plant, this promotes the use of natural wax in the candles. </p>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
            <p>Having already produced wireframes for initial research, the design phase could move straight into high-fidelity mockup making, the current website that sells this candle doesn’t have much in terms of feel or brand so near complete freedom was allowed with this. The photo shows the final design that was chosen. </p>

        <section class="solution">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Ultimately a solution that met all of the requirements and expectations was provided and this project provided a great base for further developing my user research skills and user journey mapping ability.</p>
