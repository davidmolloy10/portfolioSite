            <h2>The Task</h2>
            <p>The task for this project was to design a bespoke messaging system that allowed users to contact customer support and view FAQs, it was also important that the design was completed in such a way that allowed for it to be easily changed to fit different branding.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="requirements">
            <h2>The Requirements</h2>
            <p>The requirments of this project were straight forward, below is a list of them </p>
            <ul>
                <li>•	Participants should be able to send and receive messages to and from customer service at any stage in the application process</li>
                <li>•	If a customer service agent starts a chat the participant needs to be notified</li>
                <li>•	Messages need a 250 character limit </li>
                <li>•	Participants shouldn’t have to leave their current page to send a message</li>
                <li>•	Message history should be kept for participants to view if they change pages mid conversation</li>
                <li>•	Easily interchangeable colour scheme </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="process">
            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>The process began by looking at current candle e-commerce websites and seeing what the key details they had easily on show for users to see, using this information, three sketches were produced and had 5-second tests ran on them with users in order to gain an understanding of the design direction that would be taken. Following that, a proactive Journey Map was produced, this would help define how users would behave on the website. </p>
            <h3>Journy Map</h3>
            <p>The user journey map created once a design direction was known and could begin to think about how users would behave on a future website.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Taking the photos to produce unique content for the website was initially planned to be conducted like a solo product shoot on clear white backing to remove anything that wasn’t the product, however after perusing this path and discovering it just wasn’t working, the direction was changed to include other items/backing that would help promote features of the candle, the photo shown shows a nice healthy green plant, this promotes the use of natural wax in the candles. </p>
            <h3>High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
            <p>Having already produced wireframes for initial research, the design phase could move straight into high-fidelity mockup making, the current website that sells this candle doesn’t have much in terms of feel or brand so near complete freedom was allowed with this. The photo shows the final design that was chosen. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="solution">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Ultimately a solution that met all of the requirements and expectations was provided and this project provided a great base for further developing my user research skills and user journey mapping ability.</p>
